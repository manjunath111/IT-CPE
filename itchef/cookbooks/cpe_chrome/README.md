cpe_chrome
==========

Description
-----------
Configures any custom settings for Google Chrome, or Chrome Canary.

Requirements
------------
* Linux
* macOS
* Windows

Attributes
----------
* node['cpe_chrome']['profile']
* node['cpe_chrome']['mp']
* node['cpe_chrome']['canary_ignored_prefs']

Usage
-----
Manage all of the Chrome settings and the Master Preferences file.
`node['cpe_chrome']['profile']` is a hash of all the settings that will be
applied as managed policies. `node['cpe_chrome']['mp']` is a hash of all
settings that will be applied in Master Preferences.

### Managed Policies

For Chrome and Chrome Canary the list of managed polices can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies

All policy-managed settings are stored in the node['cpe_chrome']['profile'] hash.

To add a managed setting to your profile, simply add the key from the URL list
above to this hash:

```
{
  'DefaultBrowserSettingEnabled' => false,
  'SitePerProcess' => true
}.each do |k, v|
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['profile'][k] = v
end
```

To exclude a managed setting from Chrome Canary, add the key to the array:

```
{
  'RelaunchNotification',
  'RelaunchNotificationPeriod',
}.each do |setting|
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['canary_ignored_prefs'] << setting
end
```

#### Extensions managed by policy

`node['cpe_chrome']['profile']['ExtensionInstallForcelist']`

* Extension ids added here are enforced by policy and cannot be disabled by
  the user
* Must be the extension ID followed by the Update URL.
* The extension ID can be found in the URL from the Web Store, or at
  [chrome://extensions]()
* The Update URL for the Chrome Web Store is always
  "https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx"

This example is the LastPass extension from the Chrome Web Store:

```
# Install the LastPass extension
chrome_ext_update_url = 'https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx'
{
  'ExtensionInstallForcelist' => [
    "hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd;#{chrome_ext_update_url}",
  ],
}.each do |k, v|
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['profile'][k] = v
end
```

Likewise, extensions can be Blocklisted (and thus forcibly removed from
the browser by policy):

```
# Forcefully remove the BetterHistory malware extension
chrome_ext_update_url = 'https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx'
{
  'ExtensionInstallBlocklist' => [
    'obciceimmggglbmelaidpjlmodcebijb',
  ],
}.each do |k, v|
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['profile'][k] = v
end
```

`node['cpe_chrome']['profile']['ExtensionInstallSources']` is a list of URL
sources where extensions may be installed from.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionInstallSources
for details.

### Master Preferences

In addition to enforcing managed policies, this cookbook can also manage the
'Master Preferences' file.
See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/configuring-other-preferences for
details.

The Master Preferences file configuration is handled by the
`node['cpe_chrome']['mp']['FileContents']` attribute.
This hash should contain keys that are described in the link above.  An example:

```
node.default['cpe_chrome']['mp']['FileContents'] = {
  'bookmark_bar' => {
    'show_all_tabs' => true,
  },
  'distribution' => {
    'import_bookmarks' => false,
    'skip_first_run_ui' => false,
    'show_welcome_page' => false,
    'suppress_first_run_bubble' => true,
    'do_not_register_for_update_launch' => false,
    'verbose_logging' => true,
  },
  'first_run_tabs' => [
    'https://www.facebook.com',
  ],
  'homepage' => 'http://www.facebook.com',
  'sync_promo' => {
    'show_on_first_run_allowed' => false,
  },
  'browser' => {
    'check_default_browser' => false,
  },
}
```

The Master Preferences file will only be written to disk if the node attribute
`node['cpe_chrome']['mp']['UseMasterPreferencesFile']` is `true`:

```
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['mp']['UseMasterPreferencesFile'] = true
```

### Linux

On Linux, to avoid installing chrome and the repos, your node must have
the attributes `manage_repo` and `install_package` set to `false`:

```
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['manage_repo'] = false
  node.default['cpe_chrome']['install_package'] = false
```

These attributes are set to true by default. It can be disabled by
adding the above commands to your cpe_user_customizations::${USER}.

*macOS Only*
The profile's organization key defaults to `Facebook` unless
`node['organization']` is configured in your company's custom init recipe.

### Windows compatibility

On Windows, Chrome policy is stored in the registry, in
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome`. These registry keys
here are mapped from the `node['cpe_chrome']['profile']` attribute in the
gen_windows_chrome_known_settings.rb library, which provide a class
that converts them.

As Google adds new keys and deprecates old ones, they may need to be manually
added to the chrome_windows.rb library in order to provide support and
compatibility.

This cookbook will automatically cleanup subkeys that are stored in the policy
registry key but are not found in the node attribute.

We detect policies to manage from the Chrome ADMX template.
This does not cover *every* setting, so we also
will generate policies from a separate reference file that is manually
maintained. All reference files are `.reg` files.

To manually add a registry setting you can add it to
`win_chrome_manual_policy.reg`.

To generate settings run the script `windows_policy_gen.rb`. This assumes you
have the chefdk installed locally.

All generated settings are placed
into `libraries/gen_windows_chrome_known_settings.rb`.
